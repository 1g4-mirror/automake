	Fix exit status of signal handlers in shell scripts.
	The value of `$?' on entrance to signal handlers in shell scripts
	cannot be relied upon, so set the exit code explicitly to
	128 + SIG<SIGNAL>.
	* lib/am/check.am (am__check_pre): Use `exit 143' in signal handler.
	* lib/elisp-comp: Likewise.
	* lib/install-sh: Likewise.
	* lib/ylwrap: Likewise.  Also, fix script to trap signal 13, not 3.
	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.
	Bug report, analysis, and initial patch by Dmitry V. Levin.

2010-02-06  Karl Berry  <karl@gnu.org>

	Improve gnupload usage text.
	* gnupload (usage): Shorten to make more likely to fit on a tty
	line.  Mention CMD in the synopsis.  With ..., plural is implied.

2010-01-28  Christos Kontas  <xakon@yahoo.com>  (tiny change)

	Fix some typos in the manual
	* doc/automake.texi (Nested Packages, Rebuilding): Fix typos.

2010-01-24  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix silent-rules output for disabled dependency tracking.
	* lib/am/depend2.am [!%FASTDEP%]: Rework silent-rules variable
	expansion code to also work in the case where %AMDEP% expands
	to FALSE at config.status time, using new substitution string
	%VERBOSE-NODEP%.
	* automake.in (verbose_nodep_flag): New function, appending
	`@am__nodep@' to the verbose-variable name.
	(handle_languages): If dependencies are not disabled, use it to
	set %VERBOSE-NODEP%.
	* m4/depend.m4: Substitute am__nodep as '_no', so the second
	verbose-variable will always expand to an empty string, if
	dependencies are enabled.
	* tests/silent5.test: Also test --disable-dependency-tracking;
	also test per-target flags for non-C language files.
	* tests/silent9.test: New test, like silent4.test but disable
	dependency tracking.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.
	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.
	Report by Dmitry V. Levin <ldv@altlinux.org>.

2010-01-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Slighty improve tests acoutbs.test and acoutbs2.test.
	* tests/acoutbs2.test: Enable `errexit' shell flag.  Check that
	autoconf and configure work, that the file `zot' is created by
	configure, and that no file containing a backslash in its name is
	created.
	* tests/acoutbs.test: Likewise, plus updated copyright years.

	Fix test acoutbs2.test.
	* tests/acoutbs2: In the generated configure.in: add proper calls
	to AC_INIT and AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE, and remove explicit definition of
	PACKAGE and VERSION. Add a call to aclocal before calling automake.
	Updated copyright years.
	* tests/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Removed acoutbs2.test.

	Add forgotten test scripts to $(TESTS).
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Added test scripts present on the
