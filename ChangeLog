	tests: extend checks on the 'unindent' shell function
	* tests/self-check-unindent.test: Also check that multiple
	instances of 'unindent'	can run in parallel (this was not
	the case when that function used temporary files).

2011-03-01  Peter Rosin  <peda@lysator.liu.se>

	test defs: unindent without temporary file
	* tests/defs.in (commented_sed_unindent_prog): Commented Sed program
	that strips the "proper" amount of leading whitespace.
	(unindent): Lazily strip comments from the above program and use it
	to unindent without using a temporary file.

	libtool: suggest LT_INIT if LTLIBRARIES primary is used
	When the LTLIBRARIES primary was used, but $(LIBTOOL) wasn't
	defined, automake suggested to add a call to AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
	in configure.ac.  But that macro is deprecated since Libtool
	version 1.9b (2004-08-29), in favor of the newer LT_INIT.  So
	suggest the use of this latter macro instead.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (%_am_macro_for_var): Pair 'LIBTOOL'
	with 'LT_INIT', not with 'AC_PROG_LIBTOOL'.
	* libtool4.test: Adjust and extend.  Also, add a call to macro
	AC_PROG_CC in configure.in, to help ensuring that automake does
	not fail for the wrong reasons.
	* ltinit.test: New test, ensure that automake's libtool support
	works with LT_INIT-based interface.
	Thanks to Jack Kelly for the suggestion.

2011-02-25  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: add testcases sanity-checking the testsuite
	Helper subroutines, variables and other pieces of code defined
	in the `tests/defs' and used by many testcases are non-obvious,
	and tricky to get to work portably; but until now, they weren't
	tested at all in a clear and self-contained way.
	This change should remedy to the situation.
	* tests/self-check-cleanup.test: New test, check removal of
	temporary test working directory by `./defs'.
	* tests/self-check-dir.test: New test, check that tests using
	`./defs' create a proper temporary directory, and run in it.
	* tests/self-check-exit.test: New test, check that, in case of
	failing commands, the correct exit status is passed to the exit
	trap installed by the `./defs' script.
	* tests/self-check-is_newest.test: New test, checking the
	`is_newest' subroutine.
	* tests/self-check-me.test: New test, checking that $me gets
	defined automatically by `tests/defs' if not set, and that it
	can be overridden from either the shell or the environment.
	* tests/self-check-sanity.test: New test, check that the sanity
	checks performed by the `tests/defs' script works correctly.
	* tests/self-check-unindent.test: New test, checking the
	`unindent' subroutine.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.

2011-02-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: tempdirs with restrictive permissions are cleaned correctly
	Before this change, the removal of a temporary test directory
	containing subdirectories with restrictive permissions (such as
	'r--r--r--') could fail.
	* tests/defs: Ensure that all the subdirectories of a temporary
	test directory have the 'read', 'write' and 'execute' bits set,
	before trying to remove it with `rm -rf'.
	* tests/Makefile.am (clean-local-check): Likewise.

	tests: `instspc-*.test': do not create useless source file
	* tests/instspc-tests.sh (create_input_data): Do not create
	unused source file `source2.c'.

2011-02-15  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	tests: optimize `instspc-*.test' for speed
	After the split of `instspc.test' into various generated tests,
	the running time of the testsuite has noticeably increased, since
	all these new generated tests must run aclocal, autoconf and
	automake, whereas previously they were run only once (at the
	beginning of `instspc.test').  But luckily, since the new tests
	share the same input files for the autotools, this situation can
	be easily worked around (at the expenses of a slight increase of
	complexity for the testsuite scaffolding).
	* tests/instspc-data.test: New helper test, properly calling
	the `instspc-tests.sh' script to generate input data for the
	others `instspc-*.test' tests.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add `instspc-data.test'.
	($(instspc_tests:.test=.log)): Depend on its log file.
	(instspc-data.log): Depend on `instspc-tests.sh'.
	* tests/instspc-tests.sh: Recognize new action `generate-data',
	and use it to create hand-written and autotools-generated static
	files shared by all the `instspc-*.test' tests.
	When sourced by the `instspc-*.test' tests, use those previously
	created files instead of recreating them from scratch.
	(unindent, create_input_data): New subroutines.
	Some other related changes and refactorings.
	From a suggestion by Ralf Wildenhues.

	python: fix spurious failure in tests
	* tests/python-vars.test: Ignore cached values from config.site
	by exporting CONFIG_SITE=/dev/null.  Be laxer in matching the
	expected values of output variables `pythondir' and `pyexecdir',
	since they can change quite unpredictably among different python
	installations.  Also, avoid "hyping" debugging output, thus
	offering smaller trace output and more informative diff.
	Report and suggestions by Ralf Wildenhues.
	* tests/python-virtualenv.test: Require python, since we call it
	even after the virtualenv has been deactivated.  Ignore cached
	values from config.site by exporting CONFIG_SITE=/dev/null.

	tests: tweak few tests on simple and parallel test drivers
	* tests/check-exported-srcdir.test: Improve heading comments.

	environment won't risk to interfere with the test.
	Suggestions by Ralf Wildenhues.

2011-02-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	python: extend and improve tests, fix minor glitches
	* m4/python.m4 (AM_PATH_PYTHON): Ensure the "checking ..." messages
	from configure are always complete, even in case of failure.  Tiny
	cosmetic improvement in info/error messages.
	* tests/python.test: Also check that automake complains if the
	PYTHON primary is used but the `py-compile' script is not present.
	Make grepping of generated Makefile.in laxer w.r.t. whitespace.
	Add trailing `:' command.
	* tests/python2.test: Remove repeated calls aclocal: they are
	useless because configure.in is never modified.  Make grepping
	of automake stderr more comprehensive.  Remove the pre-existing
	`py-compile' file before trying to install it with `--add-missing'.
	Add trailing `:' command.
	* tests/python3.test: Add trailing `:' command.
	* tests/python11.test: Likewise.

	configure are always complete.  Use proper m4 quoting.  Add a
	trailing `:' command.

	created by configure rather then grepping its output.
	* tests/python7.test: Likewise.
	* tests/python8.test: Also check that `$PYTHON' is meaningfully
	set in the ACTION-IF-TRUE argument of AM_PATH_PYTHON.

	* tests/nobase-python.test: In testing "make uninstall" and
	"make install" results, prefer idioms that make verbose logs
	more helpful.  Remove a couple of lines of dead code.  Add a
	trailing `:' command.
	* tests/python5b.test: New test, checking that configure performs
	the check on the python version even when the choice of the python
	interpreter is forced by the user.
	* tests/python-dist.test: New test, checking the distribution of
	*_PYTHON files.
	* tests/python-vars.test: New test, checking that AM_PATH_PYTHON

	* tests/python-virtualenv.test: New test, checking that python
	support offered by automake works well with "virtual python
	environments" created by the `virtualenv' program.
	* tests/instdir-prog.test: Also check `$(pyexecdir)'.  Existing
	checks made slightly stricter.

	Update docs w.r.t. warning and strictness options.
	* doc/automake.texi (Strictness): Document that some warnings are
	turned off by default in `foreign' strictness.
	(Options): Divide into new sections "Options generalities" and
	"List of Automake options".  Fix typo (colon instead of full
	stop).  Document option precedence (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS wins over
	AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE which wins over command line).  Also document
	interactions between options specifying strictness and those
	specifying warnings.

	More tests on warnings/strictness precedence.
	* tests/warning-groups-win-over-strictness.test: New test, similar
	to `warnings-win-over-strictness.test', but checking the explicit

	* tests/yflags-force-override.test: New test, checking that

	yacc: "make clean" removes .c and .h files from non-distributed .y
	Previously, while automake did *not* distribute C source and header
	files derived from non-distributed Yacc sources, it still caused
	them to be removed only by "make maintainer-clean" only, and not by
	simply "make clean" or "make distclean".
	This caused "make distcheck" to fail, unless the developer put
	those generated .c and .h files in CLEANFILES or in DISTCLEANFILES
	by hand.
	This change fixes this issue, by making non-distributed `.c' and
	`.h' files generated by non-distributed Yacc sources cleaned by
	"make clean".
	* tests/automake.in (lang_yacc_target_hook): Make C source and

	testsuite run with zsh" on automake-patches, dated 2010-12-22:
	 <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2010-12/msg00135.html>
	This change works around the problems described above for Zsh 4.3
	or later, and offers better error messages (instead of random
	failures) for earlier Zsh version.
	* tests/README (Supported shells): When describing the manual
	workaround about the Zsh incompatibility in the handling of `$0',
	tell that it is now needed only with Zsh versions preceding 4.3.
	Done also some minor rewordings.
	* tests/defs-static.in ($argv0): New variable, offers a workaround
	for the Zsh incompatibility in the handling of `$0'.
	Abort if that variable cannot be correctly set (can happen only
	in older Zsh version).
	* tests/defs ($me): Define using `$argv0', not `$0'.

	Tests defs: keep track of original $AUTOMAKE and $ACLOCAL values.
	This is especially useful for tests which might want to run
	automake and aclocal without additional flags and warnings.

	($original_AUTOMAKE): Likewise.
	* tests/help.test: Use them.

2010-12-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	distlinksbrk.test: Work around botched "make -k".
	* tests/distlinksbrk.test: Run "make" multiple times and grep
	its output each time for a single error message, rather than
	running "make -k" one single time and grepping its output for
	all the expected error messages.  This should work around make
	implementations with limited (broken?) `-k' support; for more
	information, see these subthreads on the automake-patches list:
	  - 2010-11-15, "Testsuite failures on HP-UX 11.23",
	    <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake-patches/2010-11/msg00162.html>

	* NEWS: Update.

2010-11-25  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix spurious failures in `silent*.test' for $CC != gcc
	In some tests on automake-produced silent rules, we forced the
	use of gcc depmode to improve testsuite coverage; but this has
	unsurprisingly led to spurious failures when some non-GNU C
	compilers were used.  So we are now careful to require GCC in
	tests that force gcc depmode.
	From reports by Ralf Wildenhues.
	* silent5.test: Test removed, its content split into ...
	* silent-many-generic.test, silent-many-gcc.test: ... these new
	sister tests, the latter of which forces gcc depmode and lists
	"gcc" in $required.
	* silentlex.test: Test removed, its content split into ...
	* silent-lex-generic.test, silent-lex-gcc.test: ... these new
	sister tests, the latter of which forces gcc depmode and lists
	"gcc" in $required.
	* silentyacc.test: Test removed, its content split into ...
	* silent-yacc-generic.test, silent-yacc-gcc.test: ... these new
	sister tests, the latter of which forces gcc depmode and lists
	"gcc" in $required.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated.

	* tests/colon5.test: Also substitute `@SHELL@' with `$SHELL' when
	post-processing the generated Makefile.in, to work around a bug
	of AIX 5.3 make which doesn't allow setting the `$(SHELL)' macro
	on the commend line.  Calls to `$MAKE' adjusted accordingly.
	* tests/colon6.test: Likewise.
	Regression introduced in commit v1.11-175-gf9fe878 "Modernize,
	improve and/or extend tests `colon*.test", and reported by Ralf
	Wildenhues.

2010-11-16  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix regression in ansi.test (failure on AIX 5.3).
	* tests/ansi.test: Remove redundant hackish check done using a
	hand-postprocessed Makefile.in.  This check worked by setting
	the `$(SHELL)' macro on the command line of make, but this is
	not supported by the AIX 5.3 make implementation.
	This bug has been lurking for a long time, and was activated by
	commit v1.11-125-gc1f6cdb "Enable `errexit' shell flag in various

	Fix bug in test `backcompat6.test' (MSYS portability).
	* tests/backcompat6.test (Makefile.am): Grep the output from the

	Reported by Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-11-13  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	category when this macro is used.
	* doc/automake.texi (Public Macros): Move description of

	(Obsolete Macros): ... to here, and declare it as obsolete
	and "to be removed in a future version".
	* tests/regex-obsolete.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.

2010-11-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Improve and extend tests on man pages support.

	* tests/man5.test: Prefer cat + here-doc over echo to append to
	configure.in.
	* tests/man2.test: Likewise, and add trailing `:' command.
	* tests/man4.test: More thorough and consistent checking of make
	error messages.  Place fake `help2man' program in a new `bin'
	directory rather than in `.'.  Move the checks using the real
	`help2man' program to ...
	* tests/man6.test: ... this new test, and extend them.  This test
	passes with GNU make and Solaris make, still fails with BSD make.
	* tests/man7.test: New test, extracted from old man4.test, which
	checks for a bug in maintainer-clean w.r.t. generated manpages.
	* tests/man8.test: New test, extracted from old man4.test, which
	checks for a bug in distcheck w.r.t. generated manpages.  Passes
	with GNU make and Solaris make, still fails with BSD make.

2010-11-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Minor improvements and extensions to various tests.
	* tests/defun.test: Also run autoconf and grep the generated
	configure to make sure that aclocal truly picks up all the
	required macros.
	* tests/compile_f_c_cxx.test: Prefer trailing `:' over trailing
	`Exit 0'.  Do not create useless dummy source files.  Do not set
	useless `$(foo_LDADD)' variable in `Makefile.am'.  Do not call
	useless macro `AC_F77_LIBRARY_LDFLAGS' in `configure.in'.
	* tests/compile_f90_c_cxx.test: Likewise.
	* tests/suffix10.test: Slightly stricter grepping of make output.
	* tests/compile.test: Add trailing `:' command.
	* tests/defun2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/vars3.test: Likewise.
	* tests/vartar.test: Likewise.
	* tests/vars.test: Likewise.  Also, extend test by checking
	that the definition of `MY_FLAGS*' variables is preserved in
	the generated `Makefile.in'.
	* tests/stamph2.test: Prefer trailing `:' over trailing `Exit 0'.
	Use proper m4 quoting in `configure.in'.

2010-11-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Tests defs: improve messages for skipped tests.
	* tests/defs: Give meaningful messages about the reasons of a
	test skip; this is especially useful as this file is run without
	verbose xtraces on.  Related reorderings in the code and new
	comments.

2010-11-10  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Tests defs: move static definitions in a new file `defs-static'.
	The new file is meant to be idempotent w.r.t. multiple inclusions.
	* tests/defs.in: Removed, its contents split among ...
	* tests/defs-static.in: ... this new file ...
	* tests/defs: ... and this new file, including the former.
	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Remove `tests/defs', add
	`tests/defs-static'.
	(AC_CONFIG_LINKS): Add `tests/defs'.
	* tests/Makefile.am ($(parallel_tests)): Update.
	($(instspc_tests)): Likewise.
	* tests/.gitignore: Update.

	Tests defs: $testsbuilddir is now AC_SUBST'ed.
	* tests/defs.in ($testsbuilddir): Substitute from @abs_builddir@.
	Add sanity check on $testsbuilddir, similar to those on
	$testsrcdir and $top_testsrcdir.

	Tests defs: do not print message "Running test $0" anymore.
	* tests/defs.in: Printing the message "=== Running test $0" at
	the beginning of each tests made sense when Automake used the old
	test-driver, which sent all the output directly to stdout/stderr.
	Now that the parallel test-driver is used, which saves output of
	each test in its corresponding log file, that old message is just
	useless noise.

	Tests defs: rename $curdir -> $testbuilddir
	* tests/defs.in: Rename $curdir to $testbuildir, for clarity and
	consistency with $testsrcdir and $top_testsrcdir.

	Tests defs: prefer "$curdir" over "`pwd`".
	* tests/defs.in: We already save the value of `pwd` in $curdir
	early in the file, so there no need to recalculate it later, when
	the current working directory is not changed.

	Tests defs: use `$me' in more error messages.
	* tests/defs.in: Also use `$me' in error messages referring to
	missing `defs' or `defs.in', since that variable is now defined
	before those checks.

	Tests defs: do not use `Exit' where plain `exit' suffices.
	* tests/defs.in: Use "exit 77" rather than "Exit 77" to skip the
	test when required libtool/gettext macros are not found, since
	such skips would take place before the exit trap is installed.

	Tests defs: improve and extends comments.
	* tests/defs.in: Improve and extends some comments, especially in
	relation with the changes introduced by the previous reordering.

	Tests defs: various reorderings.
	* tests/defs.in: Reordered various snippets of code in a
	clearer way.

2010-11-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix bug in test `backcompat4.test' (stale autom4te cache).
	* tests/backcompat4.test: Remove stale autom4te cache directory
	before re-running aclocal and automake.  Also, since we are at
	it, be more verbose in displaying contents of generated files,
	to ease debuggability.
	Reported by Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-11-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix a bug in variable concatenation with `+='.
	* lib/Automake/VarDef.pm (append): Since the content of the
	"appended-to" variable is going to be unconditionally normalized
	later, simply separate the appended value with a single whitespace
	character, instead of trying to be uselessly smarter by using
	escaped newlines.  This fixes a bug in which extra backslashes
	where erroneously inserted in the variable's final value.
	* tests/pluseq11.test: New test, exposing the bug.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.
	Reported by Andy Wingo.

2010-11-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Modernize, improve and/or tweak various test scripts.
	* tests/stamph2.test: Improve m4 quoting in `configure.in', and
	prefer trailing `:' over trailing `Exit 0'.
	* tests/syntax.test: Escape literal dots in grep regexps.
	* tests/copy.test: Enable `errexit' shell flag.  Extend test by
	checking with `test' utility that the script `install-sh' is
	copied, but not symlinked.
	* tests/depdist.test: Move setting of `errexit' shell flag earlier
	in the script (just after inclusion of ./defs).  Avoid obsoleted
	constructs in generated `configure.in'.  Prefer to do our checks
	by running configure and make over grepping Makefile.in.
	* tests/target-cflags: Move setting of `errexit' shell flag
	earlier in the script (just after inclusion of ./defs). Use the
	`configure.in' stub created by `./defs', rather than writing it
	from scratch.
	* tests/target-clash: Do not uselessly run autoconf.
	* tests/ctarget1.test: Renamed ...
	* tests/cond-basic.test: ... to this.  Use the `configure.in' stub
	created by `./defs', rather than writing it from scratch.
	Move setting of `errexit' shell flag earlier in the script (just
	after inclusion of ./defs).  Other minor cosmetic changes.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated.

2010-11-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	New tests on obsoleted usages of automake/autoconf macros (such
	as AC_INIT, AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE and AC_OUTPUT).
	* tests/backcompat.test: New test script.
	* tests/backcompat2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/backcompat3.test: Likewise.
	* tests/backcompat4.test: Likewise.
	* tests/backcompat5.test: Likewise.
	* tests/backcompat6.test: Likewise.
	* tests/init.test: Extended and improved, esp. by trying more
	combinations of calls to AC_INIT and AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE with few
	arguments.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated.

2010-11-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix bug in rules for creating vala vapi/header files.
	* automake.in (lang_vala_finish_target): Add forgotten "fi" in an
	if control structure in a generated make rules.  Bug introduced
	by previous commit `v1.11-221-gd7c1679', and revealed by failure
	of test `vala2.test'.

2010-11-01  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix and document rules to not touch the tree with `make -n'.
	* doc/automake.texi (Multiple Outputs): Document the problem of
	modifications during dry-run execution, propose solution.
	* NEWS: Update.
	* automake.in (lang_vala_finish_target): Split recipe so the
	stamp file is not removed with GNU `make -n'.
	(lang_yacc_target_hook): Separate removal of parser output file
	and header remaking.
	* lib/am/lisp.am ($(am__ELCFILES)): Determine whether -n was
	passed to make, take care not to remove any files in that case.
	* lib/am/remake-hdr.am (%CONFIG_H%): Separate removal of
	%STAMP% file from induced remaking of config header.
	* tests/autohdrdry.test, tests/lispdry.test, tests/yaccdry.test:
	New tests.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.

2010-11-05  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix potential bug in generated tests `instpc-*.test'.
	This bug is due to the changes introduced by the recently-merged
	"tests-init" branch.  In that branch, `tests/defs' didn't define
	anymore `$srcdir', instead defining directly `$testsrcdir'; but
	the generated tests were using `$srcdir', hence the bug.
	Luckily, since the Automake parallel test driver automatically
	exports `srcdir' to a proper value, that prevented the bug from
	manifesting itself.
	* tests/Makefile.am ($(instspc_tests)): In the generated test
	scripts, use `$testsrcdir', not `$srcdir'.

2010-11-03  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Overhauled and modularized tests in `instspc.test'.
	The test `instspc.test' was way too big and fragile.  Its running
	time was very long.  It also produced a log that was nearly
	unreadable due to its length, making it very difficult to find
	out the reason for failures.
	Also, it was too much monolithic, with a single (maybe spurious)
	failure in a corner case causing the whole test to fail (even if
	everything worked as expected in the other 99% of cases).
	The present change should solve these problems, by separating
	`instspc.test' into many smaller, self-contained, auto-generated
	tests.
	* tests/instspc.test: Removed.
	* tests/instspc-tests.sh: New script, fulfilling a double role:
	1. it generates a Makefile.am snippet `tests/instspc-tests.am',
	containing the definition of a list of new tests which will take
	over the older `instspc.test', and
	2. it is sourced by said generated tests with proper parameters
	pre-set, to run the "meat" of the checks.
	This apparent abuse is indeed required because the test generation
	code and test execution code are inevitably intertwined.
	* tests/Makefile.am ($(srcdir)/instspc-tests.am): Include this
	snippet, which (among the other things) defines ...
	(instspc_tests): ... this new macro, containing the list of the

	make use of the -showIncludes option added in MSVC 7.
	* m4/depend.m4 (_AM_DEPENDENCIES): Handle the new depmodes
	similarly to 'msvisualcpp' and 'msvcmsys' as MSVC does not
	support the -o option.

2010-10-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	dist-xz, dist-bzip2: don't hard-code -9: honor envvar settings
	* lib/am/distdir.am (dist-xz): Do not hard-code xz's -9: that
	made it impossible to override.  Instead, use its XZ_OPT envvar,
	defaulting to -9 if not defined.  Thus no change in behavior
	when XZ_OPT is not set, and now, this rule honors the setting
	of that envvar when it is set.  Suggested by Lasse Collin.
	(dist-bzip2): Likewise for it's corresponding envvar: BZIP2.
	* NEWS (Miscellaneous changes): Mention it.
	* doc/automake.texi (The Types of Distributions): Describe the

	* tests/help3.test: Likewise, and fix a botched comment.
	* tests/help.test: Likewise.  Also, use "AUTOMAKE_fails ..."
	instead of "$AUTOMAKE ... && Exit 1", for consistency and to
	please maintainer-check.
	* tests/help2.test: Likewise.

	Reports from the NixOS Hydra build daemon via Ludovic Courtès.

	Fix timestamp issues by ensuring configure takes at least a second.
	* m4/sanity.m4 (AM_SANITY_CHECK): If we didn't sleep here,
	start a sleep in the background and wait for it to finish
	before creating config.status, hopefully fixing all spurious
	testsuite failures involving botched time stamps.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Reports by Ludovic Courtès, Peter Breitenlohner, and others.

2010-10-02  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Extend tests on `--help' and `--version' options.
	* tests/help.test: Create a new empty directory and chdir into
	it, rather than removing already present files.  Run the aclocal

	$AUTOMAKE and $ACLOCAL.  Be sure to correctly match literal dots
	in aclocal's and automake's stderr.  Add a trailing `:' command.
	* tests/help2.test: New test, checking that options `--help' and
	`--version' works in directories with broken `configure.in'.
	* tests/help3.test: New test, checking that options `--help' and
	`--version' take precedence on the other options.
	* tests/help4.test: New test, checking that the first among the

	* doc/automake.texi (Basics of Distribution): Also refer to `.svn'
	directories as a type of probably-unwanted files that are copied
	regardless when adding directories to EXTRA_DIST.
	(The dist Hook): Show a dist-hook example which removes Subversion
	`.svn' private directories from distdir, rather than CVS private
	directories.
	(missing and AM_MAINTAINER_MODE): Try to be more agnostic w.r.t.
	the version control system used.

	Manual: index refer to target "git-dist", not "cvs-dist".

	example about "git-dist" under the "git-dist" label, not under
	the "cvs-dist" one.

	Perl modules: remove references to "Automake CVS repository".
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm: Update comments to refer to "Automke's
	git repository" rather than to "Automake's CVS repository".

	* lib/Automake/FileUtils.pm: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/Struct.pm: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/XFile.pm: Likewise.

	Remove obsolete .cvsignore files.
	* .cvsignore, doc/.cvsignore, lib/.cvsignore, lib/am/.cvsignore,
	lib/Automake/.cvsignore, lib/Automake/tests/.cvsignore,
	m4/.cvsignore, tests/.cvsignore: Files deleted.  Even when using
	savannah's CVS readonly mirror there's no way to commit back to

	compile: implement library search to support MSVC static linking
	* lib/compile (func_cl_wrapper): Implement library search and
	-static option so that the user can select whether to prefer
	dll import libraries or static libraries.  This enables MSVC to

	or workarounds such as -lfoo.dll etc.  Makes the tests/static.at
	test case in libtool pass.
	* tests/compile3.test: Don't trip up if there happens to exist
	a "foo" library in the library search path.
	* tests/compile6.test: New test, verifying the library search.

	comments and make grepping of generated Makefile.in slightly
	stricter.
	Regression introduced by change "Modernize, improve and/or
	extend tests `colon*.test" (Stefano Lattarini, 2010-08-08).

2010-09-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Do not require "gzip" explicitly in tests.
	The gzip utility is simply expected to be present on any decent
	target system for Automake.  So it's pointless to put it in
	$required.
	* tests/install2.test ($required): Do not require "gzip".
	* tests/lex3.test: Likewise.
	* tests/pr9.test: Likewise.
	From a suggestion by Ralf Wildenhues.

	Use AS_HELP_STRING in AM_SILENT_RULES.
	* m4/silent.m4 (AM_SILENT_RULES): Use `AS_HELP_STRING' to format
	help message regarding configure options `--enable-silent-rules'

	of parentheses).
	* THANKS: Update.
	From a report by Jeff A. Daily.

2010-09-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	* tests/confh6.test: Add trailing `:' command.
	* tests/confh7.test: In comments, add reference to ...
	* tests/confh8.test: ... this new test, "semantic" sister
	of `confh7.test'.

2010-08-16  Peter Rosin  <peda@lysator.liu.se>

	Support more C++ file extensions for MSVC in the compile script.
	* lib/compile (func_cl_wrapper): MSVC only recognizes the .cpp
	file extension as C++, unless it's given a hint. So hint about

	defined).

	Tests: remove useless repetitions of `foreign' automake option.

	precedence over automake (AM_LFLAGS) and (foo_LFLAGS).  Still
	xfailing.
	* tests/lflags2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/yflags.test: New test, check that user $(YFLAGS) takes
	precedence over automake (AM_YFLAGS) and (foo_YFLAGS).  Still

	These changes make some checks slightly stricter.
	* tests/ext2.test: Call `Exit 1' if inclusion of `./defs' fails.
	* tests/gettext2.test: Place final `:' at the end of the script,

	Fix error in generation of parallel tests.
	* tests/defs.in ($am_skip_defs): New variable, to be used when

	non-verbose builds, to ensure the following builds are clean.
	Try to clean and rebuild with the same verbosity and without

	autoconf 2.60 or later, but then it checked for autoconf >= 2.62,
	and if that was not found, it gave an error saying that Automake
	required configure 2.61a-341 or later.  This change should
	eliminate such inconsistencies.

	unportable use of fgrep option `-e'.

	Fix conflnk3.test to work with Solaris/Heirloom Sh.
	* tests/conflnk3.test: Use `test -r FILE' and `test ! -r FILE'
	instead of respectively `test -e FILE' and `test ! -e FILE',
	since Solaris Sh doesn't grok the latter.  Do not SKIP the test
	if the shell doesn't support `test -e'.

2010-04-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Warning and error message formatting cleanups.

	grepping it.

2010-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make test badopt.test stricter (by enabling `set -e').
	* tests/badopt.test: Add call to `set -e'.  Due to this change,
	an unexpected failure in the call to `$ACLOCAL' (whose outcome
	was previously unchecked) would cause the whole test to fail.
	Also, bumped the copyright years.

	Make test for configure.in vs. configure.ac stricter.
	* tests/configure.test: Use a configure.in file that provokes
	an automake error, to ensure configure.ac is preferred.

	Use `set -e' in confsub.test (avoids possible false negatives).
	* tests/confsub.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag, and related
	changes (this helps avoiding some possible minor false negatives).
	Also, bumped copyright years.

2010-04-20  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix -Werror handling for presence of configure.in and configure.ac.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (Automake::Variable): Do not initialize
	$configure_ac at the global level, before command-line arguments
	have been parsed.
	(require_variables): Initialize it here.
	* tests/configure.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	Report by Stefano Lattarini.

2010-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid possible false negatives in confh5.test.
	* tests/confh5.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag, and bumped
	copyright years.  Due to this change, any unexpected failure
	in calls to $ACLOCAL, $AUTOMAKE, $AUTOCONF or $AUTOHEADER, or
	a failure in grepping expected text in output files should now
	cause the whole test to fail.

2010-04-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fixed typo in POD documentation of Automake::Channels.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm: Fixed typo in POD documentation:
	@<...> was used instead of C<...>.

2010-04-14  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Refactor tests on Automake TESTS color output.
	* tests/color.test: Tests using the expect program moved out to...
	* tests/color2.test: ... this new file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Extended accordingly.

2010-04-12  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix typos in comments in test confh5.test
	* tests/confh5.test: Fix a couple of typos in comments.

	Avoid possible false negatives in canon-name.test.
	* tests/canon-name.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag.  Improve
	test description.

2010-04-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Print 'warnings are treated as errors' note if needed.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm: Fix typo in comment.

	Adjust code to ignore 'warnings are treated as errors' note.
	* tests/location.test: Adjust expected output with -Werror.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	* NEWS: Update.

	Ensure we don't print 'warning:' or 'error:' twice.
	* Makefile.am (sc_ensure_testsuite_has_run): New helper rule.
	(sc_tests_logs_duplicate_prefixes): New rule, to check for
	wrong-looking warning and error messages in the test suite logs.
	* aclocal.in (scan_configure_dep, scan_file): Remove duplicate
	`warning: ' prefix.
	* tests/vars3.test: Rename variable to avoid false positive.

	Prepend type to warning, error, and fatal messages.
	For the first part of messages of types `error' or `fatal',
	prepend `error: ' to the message.  Prepend `warning: ' to
	warning messages, whatever the setting of -Werror.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm (partial): Move up definition.
	(_format_message): Emit `header' and `footer' strings only with
	the first resp. last part of a set of partial messages.
	* lib/Automake/ChannelDefs.pm: Add missing '1;' statement at the
	end of the module.
	(Automake::ChannelDefs): Setup warning channels with header
	`warning: ', error and fatal messages with header `error: '.
	* tests/condinc2.test, tests/ltinstloc.test: Adjust expected
	error messages.
	* tests/comment5.test: Likewise.  Also, include stack notes
	should not start with `error:'.
	* tests/location.test: Likewise.  Also, try both -Werror and
	-Wno-error.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Report by Bruno Haible.

	Fix capitalization of error messages, reword one message.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (define): Do not capitalize the first
	word in the error message.
	* automake.in (require_file_internal): Likewise.  Also, reword
	and line-wrap for better readability.
	* tests/distcom7.test, tests/pluseq5.test, tests/pluseq9.test:
	Adjust tests.

	Fix connected warnings about obsolete exeext override.
	* lib/Automake/Rule.pm (define): Merge two warnings that belong
	together, by setting the 'partial' flag for the first one.

	Fix per-Makefile.am setting of -Werror.
	Before this patch, 'AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = -Werror' in one
	Makefile.am would carry over to other Makefile.am files
	treated afterwards by the same thread, causing inconsistent
	and unstable exit status values.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm (dup_channel_setup)
	(drop_channel_setup): Save and restore the setting of
	$warnings_are_errors.
	* tests/werror3.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.
	* NEWS: Update.

2010-04-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Bugfix in confh5.test w.r.t. Solaris/Heirloom Sh.
	* tests/confh5.test: In the generated Makefile.am: do not use
	`test ! -e FILE' to check for the non-existence of a file, since
	that is not supported by Solaris/Heirloom Sh.

	Make test `aclocal3.test' stricter.
	* tests/aclocal3.test: Add call to `set -e'.  Fail if $ACLOCAL
	succeds unexpectedly.

	Add tests checking that symlinks are resolved by `make dist'.
	* tests/distlinks.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.
	Suggested by observations from Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-04-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	* lib/am/distdir.am (dist-xz, dist, dist-all): Pass -9 to xz.
	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.
	Report by Pavel Sanda.

	Avoid possible false negatives in cond46.test.
	* tests/cond46.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag (and bumped
	copyright years).  Due to this change, the testcase should now
	fail on unexpected failures in calls to $ACLOCAL/$AUTOMAKE (whose
	outcomes were previously unchecked), and on failures in grepping
	the expected diagnostic in Automake stderr.

2010-04-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Generated tests are now just a thin layer around other tests.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Rewrite the rule to generate the `*-p.test'
	test scripts so that any of them simply includes the corresponding
	`*.test' script (after setting `$parallel_tests' to `yes').
	* tests/.gitignore: Add wildcard for temporary files used in the
	generation of `*-p.test' tests.

2010-03-30  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid an unportable use of `$status' shell variable.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): Don't use the `$status' shell variable
	in the target's rules, as it's special in Zsh (equivalent to `$?',
	and readonly).

	Avoid another use of `chmod -R'.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): To be safe, do not use `chmod -R' on
	$(distdir) before removing it (as Solaris `chmod -R' touches
	symlink targets).  Instead, use the cleanup strategy used in
	distdir.am.

2010-03-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Remove uses of @acronym and @sc.
	* doc/automake.texi (Public Macros, Limitations on File Names):
	Remove all usage of @acronym and @sc in the manual.
	Suggested by Karl Berry.

2010-03-13  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	m4/options.m4, m4/substnot.m4: Fix macro comment format.

2010-03-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Avoid generation of `tests/defs-p' file.
	* tests/defs.in: In the generated `configure.in' snippet: call
	`AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE' with the `parallel-tests' option if the shell
	variable `parallel_tests' is set to `yes'.
	* tests/Makefile.am (defs-p): Target removed.
	(check_SCRIPTS): Removed `defs-p'.
	(clean-local-check): Do not unlink `defs-p' anymore.
	($(parallel_tests)): Transformation rules for the test scripts
	adjusted.
	* tests/gen-parallel-tests: Selection rules for the test
	scripts adjusted.
	* tests/parallel-tests.test: Set `$parallel_tests' to `yes'

	* tests/check8.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check9.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check10.test: Likewise.

	Fix exit status of signal handlers in shell scripts.
	The value of `$?' on entrance to signal handlers in shell scripts

	128 + SIG<SIGNAL>.
	* lib/am/check.am (am__check_pre): Use `exit 143' in signal handler.
	* lib/elisp-comp: Likewise.

	to FALSE at config.status time, using new substitution string
	%VERBOSE-NODEP%.
	* automake.in (verbose_nodep_flag): New function, appending
	`@am__nodep@' to the verbose-variable name.
	(handle_languages): If dependencies are not disabled, use it to

	verbose-variable will always expand to an empty string, if
	dependencies are enabled.
