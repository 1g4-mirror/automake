	command is always displayed.

	Make tests on user extensibility of silent-rules mode stricter.
	* tests/silent6.test: Made stricter w.r.t. the grepping of the
	output produced by `make'.
	* tests/silent7.test: Likewise.

	Tests on silent-mode for C/Libtool made stricter.
	* tests/silent.test: Made stricter w.r.t. the grepping of the

	* tests/silent4.test: Likewise.
	* tests/silent9.test: Likewise.
	* tests/silent3.test: Likewise, and add a final `make distclean'
	command to keep it better in sync with tests/silent{4,9}.test.

	Improved test silent5.test.
	* tests/silent5.test: Remove by hand all generated C files after
	non-verbose builds, to ensure the following builds are clean.
	Try to clean and rebuild with the same verbosity and without
	removing generated sources in between, to check that this does
	not trigger a different set of rules.  Make grepping of make's
	output stricter.  Improved/added some comments.

	New tests for Automake silent-mode with Fortran.
	* tests/silentf77.test: New test.
	* tests/silentf90.test: Likewise.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.

	Relax tests on silent-rules to cater to overly verbose makes.
	* tests/silent.test: When testing silent builds, don't fail if
	make's output simply contains the `mv' substring, but only if
	it contains the `mv ' substring (note the trailing space).
	* tests/silent2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/silent3.test: Likewise.
	* tests/silent4.test: Likewise.
	* tests/silent5.test: Likewise.

	Extend test on `nostdinc' automake option.
	* tests/nostdinc.test: Enable `errexit' shell flag.  Related and
	unrelated minor changes.  Make the grepping of the generated
	Makefile.in slighty stricter.  Generate and run configure, so that
	the generated Makefile can be grepped too.

2010-05-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Make gnupload portable to EBCDIC hosts.
	* lib/gnupload: Use literal newline as argument for 'tr' rather
	than \015, for EBCDIC hosts.  Also, avoid unportable nested
	double-quotes and backquotes.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Report from Eric Blake and Steve Goetze via gnulib.

2010-05-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix Autoconf version required by Automake's configure.
	Automake configure script used to tell that automake required
	autoconf 2.60 or later, but then it checked for autoconf >= 2.62,
	and if that was not found, it gave an error saying that Automake
	required configure 2.61a-341 or later.  This change should
	eliminate such inconsistencies.
	* configure.ac ($required_autoconf_version): New variable.
	Use it throughout.

2010-05-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix truncated comment in Makefile.am.

	not contain semicolon after 'b' or brace commands, for NetBSD.

	Wildcards are not portable to NetBSD make.
	* doc/automake.texi (Wildcards): Document portability issue.
	* tests/extra10.test, tests/extra11.test, tests/extra12.test:
	Require GNU make.

2010-05-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make test for configure.in vs. configure.ac stricter.
	* tests/configure.test: Use a configure.in file that provokes
	an automake error, to ensure configure.ac is preferred.

	Avoid possible false negatives in dejagnu7.test.
	* tests/dejagnu7.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag.  Also, avoid
	unportable use of fgrep option `-e'.

	* tests/conflnk3.test: Use `test -r FILE' and `test ! -r FILE'
	instead of respectively `test -e FILE' and `test ! -e FILE',
	since Solaris Sh doesn't grok the latter.  Do not SKIP the test
	if the shell doesn't support `test -e'.

2010-04-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Warning and error message formatting cleanups.
	* aclocal.in (parse_arguments, main): Remove trailing period or
	newline in error or warning messages, avoid capitalization of
	the first word of a message.
	* automake.in (check_user_variables, handle_languages)
	(handle_ltlibraries, scan_aclocal_m4, scan_autoconf_config_files)
	(scan_autoconf_files, cond_stack_if, require_file_internal)
	(usage, generate_makefile, parse_arguments): Likewise.

	* lib/gnupload (dprint, upload): Likewise.
	* tests/confdeps.test: Likewise.
	* tests/location.test: Adjust expected output.
	* automake.in (usage): In synopsis, use singular for OPTION,
	* remove space before ellipsis.
	* aclocal.in (usage): Likewise.  Also, fix indentation.

	Fix more duplicate message prefixes.
	* lib/Automake/XFile.pm (seek): Do not prepend $me.

	* aclocal.in (check_acinclude): Remove duplicate 'warning: '
	prefix.

	Fix typo in manual.
	* doc/automake.texi (Simple Tests using parallel-tests): Add
	missing closing parenthesis.

	* automake.in (read_main_am_file): Call variables_dump, not
	macros_dump.  Print actual error before list of variables.

2010-04-22  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Minor improvements in comments of test `silent3.test'.
	* tests/silent3.test: Tell to keep it in sync with `silent9.test'
	too.

2010-04-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	testsuite: ensure verbose printing of captured output.
	* tests/acloca14.test, tests/acloca18.test, tests/aclocal.test,
	tests/fort2.test, tests/help.test, tests/missing3.test,
	tests/missing6.test: Print captured stdout or stderr before
	grepping it.

2010-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make test badopt.test stricter (by enabling `set -e').
	* tests/badopt.test: Add call to `set -e'.  Due to this change,
	an unexpected failure in the call to `$ACLOCAL' (whose outcome
	was previously unchecked) would cause the whole test to fail.
	Also, bumped the copyright years.

	Make test for configure.in vs. configure.ac stricter.
	* tests/configure.test: Use a configure.in file that provokes
	an automake error, to ensure configure.ac is preferred.

	Use `set -e' in confsub.test (avoids possible false negatives).
	* tests/confsub.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag, and related
	changes (this helps avoiding some possible minor false negatives).
	Also, bumped copyright years.

2010-04-20  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix -Werror handling for presence of configure.in and configure.ac.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (Automake::Variable): Do not initialize
	$configure_ac at the global level, before command-line arguments
	have been parsed.
	(require_variables): Initialize it here.
	* tests/configure.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	Report by Stefano Lattarini.

2010-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid possible false negatives in confh5.test.
	* tests/confh5.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag, and bumped
	copyright years.  Due to this change, any unexpected failure
	in calls to $ACLOCAL, $AUTOMAKE, $AUTOCONF or $AUTOHEADER, or
	a failure in grepping expected text in output files should now
	cause the whole test to fail.

2010-04-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fixed typo in POD documentation of Automake::Channels.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm: Fixed typo in POD documentation:
	@<...> was used instead of C<...>.

2010-04-14  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Refactor tests on Automake TESTS color output.
	* tests/color.test: Tests using the expect program moved out to...
	* tests/color2.test: ... this new file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Extended accordingly.

2010-04-12  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix typos in comments in test confh5.test
	* tests/confh5.test: Fix a couple of typos in comments.

	Avoid possible false negatives in canon-name.test.
	* tests/canon-name.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag.  Improve
	test description.

2010-04-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Print 'warnings are treated as errors' note if needed.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm: Fix typo in comment.
	(_print_message): If -Werror is enabled, print a 'warnings are
	treated as errors' note before the first such warning.

	Adjust code to ignore 'warnings are treated as errors' note.
	* tests/location.test: Adjust expected output with -Werror.
	* tests/werror4.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	* NEWS: Update.

	Ensure we don't print 'warning:' or 'error:' twice.
	* Makefile.am (sc_ensure_testsuite_has_run): New helper rule.
	(sc_tests_logs_duplicate_prefixes): New rule, to check for
	wrong-looking warning and error messages in the test suite logs.
	* aclocal.in (scan_configure_dep, scan_file): Remove duplicate
	`warning: ' prefix.
	* tests/vars3.test: Rename variable to avoid false positive.

	Prepend type to warning, error, and fatal messages.
	For the first part of messages of types `error' or `fatal',
	prepend `error: ' to the message.  Prepend `warning: ' to
	warning messages, whatever the setting of -Werror.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm (partial): Move up definition.
	(_format_message): Emit `header' and `footer' strings only with
	the first resp. last part of a set of partial messages.
	* lib/Automake/ChannelDefs.pm: Add missing '1;' statement at the
	end of the module.
	(Automake::ChannelDefs): Setup warning channels with header
	`warning: ', error and fatal messages with header `error: '.
	* tests/condinc2.test, tests/ltinstloc.test: Adjust expected
	error messages.
	* tests/comment5.test: Likewise.  Also, include stack notes
	should not start with `error:'.
	* tests/location.test: Likewise.  Also, try both -Werror and
	-Wno-error.
	* NEWS: Update.
	Report by Bruno Haible.

	Fix capitalization of error messages, reword one message.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (define): Do not capitalize the first
	word in the error message.
	* automake.in (require_file_internal): Likewise.  Also, reword
	and line-wrap for better readability.
	* tests/distcom7.test, tests/pluseq5.test, tests/pluseq9.test:
	Adjust tests.

	Fix connected warnings about obsolete exeext override.
	* lib/Automake/Rule.pm (define): Merge two warnings that belong
	together, by setting the 'partial' flag for the first one.

	Fix per-Makefile.am setting of -Werror.
	Before this patch, 'AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = -Werror' in one
	Makefile.am would carry over to other Makefile.am files
	treated afterwards by the same thread, causing inconsistent
	and unstable exit status values.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm (dup_channel_setup)
	(drop_channel_setup): Save and restore the setting of
	$warnings_are_errors.
	* tests/werror3.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.
	* NEWS: Update.

2010-04-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Bugfix in confh5.test w.r.t. Solaris/Heirloom Sh.
	* tests/confh5.test: In the generated Makefile.am: do not use
	`test ! -e FILE' to check for the non-existence of a file, since
	that is not supported by Solaris/Heirloom Sh.

	Make test `aclocal3.test' stricter.
	* tests/aclocal3.test: Add call to `set -e'.  Fail if $ACLOCAL
	succeds unexpectedly.

	Add tests checking that symlinks are resolved by `make dist'.
	* tests/distlinks.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.
	Suggested by observations from Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-04-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Use -9 for maximum xz compression with dist-xz.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (dist-xz, dist, dist-all): Pass -9 to xz.
	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.
	Report by Pavel Sanda.

2010-04-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid possible false negatives in cond46.test.
	* tests/cond46.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag (and bumped
	copyright years).  Due to this change, the testcase should now
	fail on unexpected failures in calls to $ACLOCAL/$AUTOMAKE (whose
	outcomes were previously unchecked), and on failures in grepping
	the expected diagnostic in Automake stderr.

2010-04-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Generated tests are now just a thin layer around other tests.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Rewrite the rule to generate the `*-p.test'
	test scripts so that any of them simply includes the corresponding
	`*.test' script (after setting `$parallel_tests' to `yes').
	* tests/.gitignore: Add wildcard for temporary files used in the
	generation of `*-p.test' tests.

2010-03-30  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid an unportable use of `$status' shell variable.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): Don't use the `$status' shell variable
	in the target's rules, as it's special in Zsh (equivalent to `$?',
	and readonly).

	Avoid another use of `chmod -R'.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): To be safe, do not use `chmod -R' on
	$(distdir) before removing it (as Solaris `chmod -R' touches
	symlink targets).  Instead, use the cleanup strategy used in
	distdir.am.

2010-03-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Remove uses of @acronym and @sc.
	* doc/automake.texi (Public Macros, Limitations on File Names):
	Remove all usage of @acronym and @sc in the manual.
	Suggested by Karl Berry.

2010-03-13  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	GNU hello uses fdl.texi, not gpl.texi.
	* doc/automake.texi (Texinfo): Adjust example to upstream
	change.

2010-03-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Formatting cleanups in macro comments.
	* automake.in, lib/Automake/Channels.pm,
	lib/Automake/FileUtils.pm, lib/Automake/Options.pm,
	lib/Automake/Variable.pm, lib/Automake/XFile.pm,
	m4/options.m4, m4/substnot.m4: Fix macro comment format.

2010-03-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Avoid generation of `tests/defs-p' file.
	* tests/defs.in: In the generated `configure.in' snippet: call
	`AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE' with the `parallel-tests' option if the shell
	variable `parallel_tests' is set to `yes'.
	* tests/Makefile.am (defs-p): Target removed.
	(check_SCRIPTS): Removed `defs-p'.
	(clean-local-check): Do not unlink `defs-p' anymore.
	($(parallel_tests)): Transformation rules for the test scripts
	adjusted.
	* tests/gen-parallel-tests: Selection rules for the test
	scripts adjusted.
	* tests/parallel-tests.test: Set `$parallel_tests' to `yes'
	then include `./defs' (rather than simply including `./defs-p').
	* tests/parallel-tests2.test: Likewise.

	behaviour.  Some other minor related improvements.
	* tests/.gitignore (defs-p): Removed.

2010-03-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Remove redundant unset of variable TESTS from some test scripts.
	* tests/color.test: Do not unset the `TESTS' variable, as it's
	already unset in the `defs' file.
	* tests/check5.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check8.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check9.test: Likewise.
