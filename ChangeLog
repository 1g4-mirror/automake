2010-07-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Modernize and improve test scripts `subdir*.test'.
	* tests/subdir.test: Enable `errexit' shell flag, and related
	changes.  Use the `configure.in' stub created by `./defs',
	rather than writing one from scratch.
	* tests/subdir2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/subdir4.test: Likewise.
	* tests/subdir3.test: Enable `errexit' shell flag, and related
	changes.  Do not create useless dummy source files.

	and in subdirs) stricter.  Some minor changes to keep it more
	in sync with the related test `subdir8.test'.
	* tests/subdir8.test: Likewise (but with the related test being
	`subdir5.test' here).
	* tests/subdir6.test: Cosmetic change in spacing.
	* tests/subdir9.test: Define and use new variable `$distdir'.  Add
	trailing `:' command.
	* tests/subdir10.test: Cosmetic consistency-related change.
	* tests/subdirbuiltsources.test: Cosmetic changes in spacings.
	(configure.in): Use stub created by `./defs', rather than writing
	it from scratch.  Do not use obsoleted and/or deprecated forms of
	autoconf/automake macros.

	Modernize and improve test scripts `dist*.test'.
	* tests/distcleancheck.test: Do not add useless `-e' option to
	a $MAKE call.  Extend test by grepping stderr of make.
	* tests/distcom2.test: Do not run the same test script on the
	Makefile.in twice, but save its output in an intermediate file
	instead.  Make grepping of DIST_COMMON definition stricter.

	and stderr.  Make grepping of captured stderr stricter.  Also,
	add trailing `:' command.

	script in subroutine `extract_distcommon'.
	* tests/distcom7.test: Prefer cat + here-doc over echo to write
	test Makefile.am files.  Add a trailing `:' command.
	* tests/distname.test: Prefer `gzip -d' over `gunzip'.  Move the
	call to `set -e' earlier.  Be stricter and more verbose in the
	checking of the generated tarball.
	(configure.in): Use the stub provided by ./defs, instead of
	writing it from scratch.  Avoid obsoleted constructs.  Remove
	useless call to `AM_PROG_CC_C_O'.
	* tests/distdir.test: Various minor improvements/normalizations.
	* tests/distlinks.test: Likewise.

2010-07-18  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Improve and extend test cond5.test.
	* tests/cond5.test: Do not blindly sleep 60 seconds before polling
	the background automake process, but poll it every 10 seconds for
	at most 30 times (this makes the test both faster on good machines,
	and more resilient to spurious timeout-due failures when in low
	priority or on heavily-loaded systems).
	Check also that automake writes the expected error messages on the
	standard error.
	Enable `errexit' flag, and related changes.
	Rely on the `configure.in' stub created by `./defs', rather than
	writing one from scratch.

	defined).

	Tests: remove useless repetitions of `foreign' automake option.
	* tests/multlib.test (configure.in): Remove useless use of
	`foreign' option in AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE (the `--foreign' option is

	Fix bugs in Automake Yacc/Lex support w.r.t. $(AM_FLAGS) and
	$(FLAGS) precedence.
	* automake.in: Fix registration of languages "Lex", "Lex (C++)",
	"Yacc" and "Yacc (C++)", so that $(LFLAGS) has precedence over

	New tests, exposing bugs in Automake Yacc/Lex support w.r.t.
	$(AM_FLAGS) and $(FLAGS) precedence.
	* tests/lflags.test: New test, check that user $(LFLAGS) takes
	precedence over automake (AM_LFLAGS) and (foo_LFLAGS).  Still
	xfailing.
	* tests/lflags2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/yflags.test: New test, check that user $(YFLAGS) takes
	precedence over automake (AM_YFLAGS) and (foo_YFLAGS).  Still

	might unmotivatedly hide useful information.
	* tests/suffix2.test: Move setting of `errexit' shell flag earlier
	in the script (just after inclusion of ./defs).  Use a more
	idiomatic way to count text occurrences in Makefile.in with
	grep.  Do not create useless dummy source files.
	* tests/suffix10.test: Ensure verbose printing of captured make
	stdout.  Minor cosmetic changes.

	in ./defs).  Avoid potential problems with unpredictable make
	output.  Finally, make grepping of Makefile.in stricter.

	which are exported by BSD make when run in parallel mode, and
	which can confuse make processes spawned by our testsuite.
	This change fixes a lot of spurious failure when the testsuite
	is run with BSD make in parallel mode.

2010-06-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Rewrite manual to be gender-neutral.
	* doc/automake.texi (GNU Build System)
	(Standard Directory Variables, General Operation, CVS)

	* tests/silent6.test: Made stricter w.r.t. the grepping of the
	output produced by `make'.
	* tests/silent7.test: Likewise.

	Tests on silent-mode for C/Libtool made stricter.

	Improved test silent5.test.
	* tests/silent5.test: Remove by hand all generated C files after
	non-verbose builds, to ensure the following builds are clean.
	Try to clean and rebuild with the same verbosity and without
	removing generated sources in between, to check that this does
	not trigger a different set of rules.  Make grepping of make's
	output stricter.  Improved/added some comments.

	New tests for Automake silent-mode with Fortran.
	* tests/silentf77.test: New test.
	* tests/silentf90.test: Likewise.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.

	* tests/silent5.test: Likewise.
	* tests/silent9.test: Likewise.

2010-01-24  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix silent-rules output for disabled dependency tracking.
	* lib/am/depend2.am [!%FASTDEP%]: Rework silent-rules variable
	expansion code to also work in the case where %AMDEP% expands
	to FALSE at config.status time, using new substitution string
	%VERBOSE-NODEP%.
	* automake.in (verbose_nodep_flag): New function, appending
	`@am__nodep@' to the verbose-variable name.
	(handle_languages): If dependencies are not disabled, use it to
	set %VERBOSE-NODEP%.
	* m4/depend.m4: Substitute am__nodep as '_no', so the second
	verbose-variable will always expand to an empty string, if
	dependencies are enabled.
	* tests/silent5.test: Also test --disable-dependency-tracking;
	also test per-target flags for non-C language files.
	* tests/silent9.test: New test, like silent4.test but disable
	dependency tracking.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.
	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.
	Report by Dmitry V. Levin <ldv@altlinux.org>.

2010-05-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Extend test on `nostdinc' automake option.
	* tests/nostdinc.test: Enable `errexit' shell flag.  Related and
	unrelated minor changes.  Make the grepping of the generated
	Makefile.in slighty stricter.  Generate and run configure, so that
	the generated Makefile can be grepped too.

2010-05-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Make gnupload portable to EBCDIC hosts.
	* lib/gnupload: Use literal newline as argument for 'tr' rather
	than \015, for EBCDIC hosts.  Also, avoid unportable nested
	double-quotes and backquotes.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Report from Eric Blake and Steve Goetze via gnulib.

2010-05-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix Autoconf version required by Automake's configure.
	Automake configure script used to tell that automake required
	autoconf 2.60 or later, but then it checked for autoconf >= 2.62,
	and if that was not found, it gave an error saying that Automake
	required configure 2.61a-341 or later.  This change should
	eliminate such inconsistencies.
	* configure.ac ($required_autoconf_version): New variable.
	Use it throughout.

2010-05-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix unportable sed script in maintainer-check test.
	* Makefile.am (sc_tests_Exit_not_exit): Rewrite sed script to
	not contain semicolon after 'b' or brace commands, for NetBSD.

	Wildcards are not portable to NetBSD make.
	* doc/automake.texi (Wildcards): Document portability issue.
	* tests/extra10.test, tests/extra11.test, tests/extra12.test:
	Require GNU make.

2010-05-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make test for configure.in vs. configure.ac stricter.
	* tests/configure.test: Use a configure.in file that provokes
	an automake error, to ensure configure.ac is preferred.

	Avoid possible false negatives in dejagnu7.test.
	* tests/dejagnu7.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag.  Also, avoid
	unportable use of fgrep option `-e'.

	Fix conflnk3.test to work with Solaris/Heirloom Sh.
	* tests/conflnk3.test: Use `test -r FILE' and `test ! -r FILE'
	instead of respectively `test -e FILE' and `test ! -e FILE',
	since Solaris Sh doesn't grok the latter.  Do not SKIP the test
	if the shell doesn't support `test -e'.

2010-04-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix typo in manual.
	* doc/automake.texi (Simple Tests using parallel-tests): Add
	missing closing parenthesis.

	Fix leftover call to removed function macros_dump.
	* automake.in (read_main_am_file): Call variables_dump, not
	macros_dump.  Print actual error before list of variables.

2010-04-25  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Minor improvements in comments of test `silent3.test'.
	* tests/silent3.test: Tell to keep it in sync with `silent9.test'
	too.

2010-04-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	testsuite: ensure verbose printing of captured output.
	* tests/acloca14.test, tests/acloca18.test, tests/aclocal.test,
	tests/fort2.test, tests/help.test, tests/missing3.test,
	tests/missing6.test: Print captured stdout or stderr before
	grepping it.

2010-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make test badopt.test stricter (by enabling `set -e').
	* tests/badopt.test: Add call to `set -e'.  Due to this change,
	an unexpected failure in the call to `$ACLOCAL' (whose outcome
	was previously unchecked) would cause the whole test to fail.
	Also, bumped the copyright years.

	Make test for configure.in vs. configure.ac stricter.
	* tests/configure.test: Use a configure.in file that provokes
	an automake error, to ensure configure.ac is preferred.

	Use `set -e' in confsub.test (avoids possible false negatives).
	* tests/confsub.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag, and related
	changes (this helps avoiding some possible minor false negatives).
	Also, bumped copyright years.

2010-04-20  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix -Werror handling for presence of configure.in and configure.ac.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (Automake::Variable): Do not initialize
	$configure_ac at the global level, before command-line arguments
	have been parsed.
	(require_variables): Initialize it here.
	* tests/configure.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	Report by Stefano Lattarini.

2010-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid possible false negatives in confh5.test.
	* tests/confh5.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag, and bumped
	copyright years.  Due to this change, any unexpected failure
	in calls to $ACLOCAL, $AUTOMAKE, $AUTOCONF or $AUTOHEADER, or
	a failure in grepping expected text in output files should now
	cause the whole test to fail.

2010-04-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fixed typo in POD documentation of Automake::Channels.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm: Fixed typo in POD documentation:
	@<...> was used instead of C<...>.

2010-04-14  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Refactor tests on Automake TESTS color output.
	* tests/color.test: Tests using the expect program moved out to...
	* tests/color2.test: ... this new file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Extended accordingly.

2010-04-12  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix typos in comments in test confh5.test
	* tests/confh5.test: Fix a couple of typos in comments.

	Avoid possible false negatives in canon-name.test.
	* tests/canon-name.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag.  Improve
	test description.

2010-04-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix per-Makefile.am setting of -Werror.
	Before this patch, 'AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = -Werror' in one
	Makefile.am would carry over to other Makefile.am files
	treated afterwards by the same thread, causing inconsistent
	and unstable exit status values.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm (dup_channel_setup)
	(drop_channel_setup): Save and restore the setting of
	$warnings_are_errors.
	* tests/werror3.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.
	* NEWS: Update.

2010-04-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Bugfix in confh5.test w.r.t. Solaris/Heirloom Sh.
	* tests/confh5.test: In the generated Makefile.am: do not use
	`test ! -e FILE' to check for the non-existence of a file, since
	that is not supported by Solaris/Heirloom Sh.

	Make test `aclocal3.test' stricter.
	* tests/aclocal3.test: Add call to `set -e'.  Fail if $ACLOCAL
	succeds unexpectedly.

	Add tests checking that symlinks are resolved by `make dist'.
	* tests/distlinks.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.
	Suggested by observations from Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-04-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Use -9 for maximum xz compression with dist-xz.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (dist-xz, dist, dist-all): Pass -9 to xz.
	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.
	Report by Pavel Sanda.

2010-03-30  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid an unportable use of `$status' shell variable.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): Don't use the `$status' shell variable
	in the target's rules, as it's special in Zsh (equivalent to `$?',
	and readonly).

	Avoid another use of `chmod -R'.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): To be safe, do not use `chmod -R' on
	$(distdir) before removing it (as Solaris `chmod -R' touches
	symlink targets).  Instead, use the cleanup strategy used in
	distdir.am.

2010-03-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Remove uses of @acronym and @sc.
	* doc/automake.texi (Public Macros, Limitations on File Names):
	Remove all usage of @acronym and @sc in the manual.
	Suggested by Karl Berry.

2010-03-13  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	GNU hello uses fdl.texi, not gpl.texi.
	* doc/automake.texi (Texinfo): Adjust example to upstream
	change.

2010-03-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	lib/Automake/FileUtils.pm, lib/Automake/Options.pm,
	lib/Automake/Variable.pm, lib/Automake/XFile.pm,
	m4/options.m4, m4/substnot.m4: Fix macro comment format.

2010-03-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Avoid generation of `tests/defs-p' file.
	* tests/defs.in: In the generated `configure.in' snippet: call
	`AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE' with the `parallel-tests' option if the shell
	variable `parallel_tests' is set to `yes'.
	* tests/Makefile.am (defs-p): Target removed.
	(check_SCRIPTS): Removed `defs-p'.
	(clean-local-check): Do not unlink `defs-p' anymore.
	($(parallel_tests)): Transformation rules for the test scripts
	adjusted.
	* tests/gen-parallel-tests: Selection rules for the test
	scripts adjusted.
	* tests/parallel-tests.test: Set `$parallel_tests' to `yes'

	* tests/parallel-tests4.test: Likewise.
	* tests/parallel-tests5.test: Likewise.

	Remove redundant unset of variable TESTS from some test scripts.
	* tests/color.test: Do not unset the `TESTS' variable, as it's
	already unset in the `defs' file.
	* tests/check5.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check8.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check9.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check10.test: Likewise.

	in EXTRA_DIST.
	* tests/extra11.test: New test, check more complex usage of
	wildcards in EXTRA_DIST.
	* tests/extra12.test: New test, check usage of wildcards in
	EXTRA_DIST when $builddir != $srcdir.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.
	Necessity of these new tests suggested by Braden McDaniel
	and Ralf Wildenhues.
