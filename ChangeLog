	Avoid possible false negatives in cond46.test.
	* tests/cond46.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag (and bumped
	copyright years).  Due to this change, the testcase should now
	fail on unexpected failures in calls to $ACLOCAL/$AUTOMAKE (whose
	outcomes were previously unchecked), and on failures in grepping
	the expected diagnostic in Automake stderr.

	Make test `aclocal3.test' stricter.
	* tests/aclocal3.test: Add call to `set -e'.  Fail if $ACLOCAL
	succeds unexpectedly.

	Add tests checking that symlinks are resolved by `make dist'.
	* tests/distlinks.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.
	Suggested by observations from Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-04-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Use -9 for maximum xz compression with dist-xz.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (dist-xz, dist, dist-all): Pass -9 to xz.
	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.
	Report by Pavel Sanda.

2010-03-30  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid an unportable use of `$status' shell variable.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): Don't use the `$status' shell variable
	in the target's rules, as it's special in Zsh (equivalent to `$?',
	and readonly).

	Avoid another use of `chmod -R'.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): To be safe, do not use `chmod -R' on
	$(distdir) before removing it (as Solaris `chmod -R' touches
	symlink targets).  Instead, use the cleanup strategy used in
	distdir.am.

2010-03-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Remove uses of @acronym and @sc.
	* doc/automake.texi (Public Macros, Limitations on File Names):
	Remove all usage of @acronym and @sc in the manual.
	Suggested by Karl Berry.

	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Avoid generation of `tests/defs-p' file.
	* tests/defs.in: In the generated `configure.in' snippet: call
	`AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE' with the `parallel-tests' option if the shell

	(check_SCRIPTS): Removed `defs-p'.
	(clean-local-check): Do not unlink `defs-p' anymore.
	($(parallel_tests)): Transformation rules for the test scripts
	adjusted.
	* tests/gen-parallel-tests: Selection rules for the test
	scripts adjusted.
	* tests/parallel-tests.test: Set `$parallel_tests' to `yes'
	then include `./defs' (rather than simply including `./defs-p').

	Remove redundant unset of variable TESTS from some test scripts.

	* tests/check8.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check9.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check10.test: Likewise.

	* tests/extra12.test: New test, check usage of wildcards in
	EXTRA_DIST when $builddir != $srcdir.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.
	Necessity of these new tests suggested by Braden McDaniel
	and Ralf Wildenhues.

	The value of `$?' on entrance to signal handlers in shell scripts
