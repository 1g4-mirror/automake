2011-01-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Improve, extend and tweak tests on Texinfo support.
	* tests/instdir-texi.test: Add a call to `ls -l' after that to
	`make', for debugging.  When looking for required tools, do not
	redirect the output of "$tool --help" to /dev/null, and do not
	uselessly run it in a subshell.
	* tests/txinfo.test: Rewritten to run autoconf, ./configure and
	make.  All checks moved into Makefile.am.
	* tests/txinfo8.test: Likewise, and modernize the generated
	configure.in.
	* tests/txinfo2.test: Moved checks into Makefile.am, and other
	minor improvements.
	* tests/txinfo5.test: Enable `errexit' shell flag, and related
	changes.  Add trailing `:' command.
	* tests/txinfo6.test: Likewise, and make grepping of generated
	Makefile.in stricter.

	to be generated only once really are.  Make grepping less strict,
	to avoid exposing too much internal details.  More minor changes.
	* tests/txinfo16.test: Add trailing `:'.  Prefer cat over echo
	for appending to configure.in.  Updated/fixed heading comments.
	* tests/txinfo23.test: Likewise, and extended a little by making
	it check that no info file is created in the $(srcdir).
	* tests/txinfo24.test: Likewise.
	* tests/txinfo25.test: Likewise.
	* tests/txinfo18.test: Add trailing `:'.  Prefer cat over echo
	for appending to configure.in.  Also, check that index files are
	cleaned also by "make clean", not only by "make distclean".
	* tests/txinfo22.test: Prefer `$me' over hard-coded test name,
	and added trailing `:' command.  This testcase also used to check
	that automake ignores in-line comments when using variables, but
	preserves them in the output; these checks (added in commit
	"Release-1-7f-4-g9177ef8") do not really pertain to this test,
	so they have been moved ...
	* tests/comments-in-var-defn.test: ... into this new test.

	minor cosmetic improvements.

	Fix spurious failures in `silent*.test' for $CC != gcc
	In some tests on automake-produced silent rules, we forced the
	use of gcc depmode to improve testsuite coverage; but this has
	unsurprisingly led to spurious failures when some non-GNU C
	compilers were used.  So we are now careful to require GCC in
	tests that force gcc depmode.
	From reports by Ralf Wildenhues.
	* silent5.test: Test removed, its content split into ...
	* silent-many-generic.test, silent-many-gcc.test: ... these new

	* lib/Automake/Config.in: Remove extra trailing semicolon.

	help4.test: fix botched heading comment.
	* tests/help4.test: Fixed the heading comment, since it
	didn't correctly describe what checks the testcase was
	supposed to perform.

	help2.test: add checks on aclocal too.
	* tests/help2.test: Check that also `aclocal --version' and
	`aclocal --help' work with configure.in and acinclude.m4 both
	broken.

	very first version of this test script.

2010-11-16  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix regression in colon{5,6}.test (failures on AIX 5.3).
	* tests/colon5.test: Also substitute `@SHELL@' with `$SHELL' when
	post-processing the generated Makefile.in, to work around a bug
	of AIX 5.3 make which doesn't allow setting the `$(SHELL)' macro
	on the commend line.  Calls to `$MAKE' adjusted accordingly.
	* tests/colon6.test: Likewise.
	Regression introduced in commit v1.11-175-gf9fe878 "Modernize,
	improve and/or extend tests `colon*.test", and reported by Ralf
	Wildenhues.

2010-11-16  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix regression in ansi.test (failure on AIX 5.3).
	* tests/ansi.test: Remove redundant hackish check done using a
	hand-postprocessed Makefile.in.  This check worked by setting
	the `$(SHELL)' macro on the command line of make, but this is
	not supported by the AIX 5.3 make implementation.
	This bug has been lurking for a long time, and was activated by
	commit v1.11-125-gc1f6cdb "Enable `errexit' shell flag in various
	tests".  Report by Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-11-16  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

2010-11-14  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	tests: work around dash quoting issue in case statements.
	* tests/color.test, tests/color2.test: Quote variable in case
	pattern, to avoid skipping tests with dash 0.5.5.1.

2010-11-14  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Rebuild menus in the manual.
	* doc/automake.texi: Rebuild menus (using ^C ^U ^A in emacs).
	Thanks to Ian Lance Taylor for the suggestion.

	Fix install-strip when $(STRIP) contains several words.
	* lib/am/install.am (install-strip): Update comment.  Use

	Found by NixOS Hydra.

2010-11-07  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix a bug in variable concatenation with `+='.
	* lib/Automake/VarDef.pm (append): Since the content of the
	"appended-to" variable is going to be unconditionally normalized
	later, simply separate the appended value with a single whitespace
	character, instead of trying to be uselessly smarter by using
	escaped newlines.  This fixes a bug in which extra backslashes
	where erroneously inserted in the variable's final value.
	* tests/pluseq11.test: New test, exposing the bug.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Update.
	Reported by Andy Wingo.

	if control structure in a generated make rules.  Bug introduced
	by previous commit `v1.11-221-gd7c1679', and revealed by failure
	of test `vala2.test'.

2010-11-01  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Improve tests `help*.test' (also fixes maintcheck failures).
	* tests/help.test: To run automake, use `$AUTOMAKE' with all `-W'

	get matched as a rule.
	Suggestion by Ben Pfaff.

2010-10-02  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Revert "parallel-tests: avoid command-line length limit issue."
	This reverts commit 24e3b4ee2f8cb9f72dd94a05a893f3d4e88b7835,
	because it re-opened the bug fixed by v1.11-10-g218e678.

	w32 (MSYS).
	* NEWS: Update.
	Report by Bob Friesenhahn.

2010-09-26  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Extend tests on `--help' and `--version' options.
	* tests/help.test: Create a new empty directory and chdir into
	it, rather than removing already present files.  Run the aclocal
	and automake wrapper scripts directly, instead of relying on
	$AUTOMAKE and $ACLOCAL.  Be sure to correctly match literal dots
	in aclocal's and automake's stderr.  Add a trailing `:' command.
	* tests/help2.test: New test, checking that options `--help' and
	`--version' works in directories with broken `configure.in'.
	* tests/help3.test: New test, checking that options `--help' and
	`--version' take precedence on the other options.

	Manual: be more agnostic w.r.t. version control system used.
	* doc/automake.texi (Basics of Distribution): Also refer to `.svn'
	directories as a type of probably-unwanted files that are copied
	regardless when adding directories to EXTRA_DIST.
	(The dist Hook): Show a dist-hook example which removes Subversion
	`.svn' private directories from distdir, rather than CVS private
	directories.

	the version control system used.

	Manual: index refer to target "git-dist", not "cvs-dist".

	* lib/Automake/Struct.pm: Likewise.
	* lib/Automake/XFile.pm: Likewise.

	lib/Automake/.cvsignore, lib/Automake/tests/.cvsignore,
	m4/.cvsignore, tests/.cvsignore: Files deleted.  Even when using
	savannah's CVS readonly mirror there's no way to commit back to
	the real repository, so this files are not worth maintaining or
	keeping around.

2010-09-21  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	* m4/dmalloc.m4: Bump serial number and copyright years.

	that made the test useless.  Since we are at it, improve
	comments and make grepping of generated Makefile.in slightly
	stricter.
	Regression introduced by change "Modernize, improve and/or
	extend tests `colon*.test" (Stefano Lattarini, 2010-08-08).

2010-09-08  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Do not require "gzip" explicitly in tests.
	The gzip utility is simply expected to be present on any decent
	target system for Automake.  So it's pointless to put it in
	$required.
	* tests/install2.test ($required): Do not require "gzip".
	* tests/lex3.test: Likewise.
	* tests/pr9.test: Likewise.
	From a suggestion by Ralf Wildenhues.

	Make some `confh*.test' tests more "semantic" (plus tweakings).
	* tests/confh.test: Run "autoconf", "configure" and "make check",
	instead of munging/grepping the generated `Makefile.in'.
	* tests/confh4.test: Relax the grepping of Makefile.in w.r.t.
	white spaces.  Do not create useless dummy source file `foo.c'

	* tests/depcomp5.test: Likewise.

2010-08-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Docs: clarify how to avoid automatic dependencies tracking.
	* doc/automake.texi (Automatic dependency tracking): Mention that
	automatic dependencies tracking is enabled by default, but that

	flag earlier in the script (just after inclusion of ./defs).

	Also, add trailing `:' command, and cosmetic changes in spacing.
	* tests/pr224.test: Move setting of `errexit' shell flag earlier
	in the script (just after inclusion of ./defs).  Do not export
	`CC=gcc' to configure explicitly (it's already exported globally
	in ./defs, since we have "gcc" in $required).  Use the stub for
	`configure.in' created by ./defs, rather than writing it from
	scratch.  Do not create dummy files required by "gnu" mode (e.g.

	`--enable-dependecy-tracking' to the ./configure call.
	* tests/pr279.test: Avoid obsolescent constructs in the generated
	`configure.in'; also, use the `configure.in' stub created by
	./defs, rather than writing it from scratch.  Enable `errexit'
	shell flag, and related changes.  Add trailing `:' command.
	* tests/pr279-2.test: Likewise, and make grepping of Makefile.in
	stricter.

	in the script (just after inclusion of ./defs).  Escape literal

	not called by `make install', but that data files are installed.
	Use proper m4 quoting in configure.in. Add trailing `:' command.
	* tests/condhook2.test: New test, sister test of condhook, with
	inverted semantic.
	* tests/condinc2.test: Use proper m4 quoting in configure.in.
	Prefer trailing `:' command over trailing `Exit 0'.
	* tests/condman2.test: Enable errexit shell flag, and related

	* tests/condman.test: Likewise.  Also, do not create useless
	dummy manpages, and use proper m4 quoting in configure.in.

	it also runs ./configure and "make install", and check the
	installed files.

	Improve and extend test cond5.test.
	* tests/cond5.test: Do not blindly sleep 60 seconds before polling
	the background automake process, but poll it every 10 seconds for
	at most 30 times (this makes the test both faster on good machines,

	precedence over automake (AM_LFLAGS) and (foo_LFLAGS).  Still
	xfailing.

2010-06-12  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Extend tests/README w.r.t. trailing `:' in test scripts.
	* tests/README (section "Writing test cases" subsection "Do"):
	Explain why apparently redundant trailing `:' and `Exit 0' in
	test scripts can indeed be useful.

2010-06-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Improve determination of PATH separator in bootstrap script.
	* bootstrap: Determine what the PATH separator is the same way
	autoconf does.

	Minor improvements in bootstrap script.
	* bootstrap: Consistently use two-spaces indentation.  Cosmetic
	improvement to comments.
	($me): New variable, containing program basename.
	Prepend it to all error messages.

	Testsuite now works with BSD make in parallel mode.
	* tests/defs.in: Unset variables __MKLVL__ and MAKE_JOBS_FIFO,
	which are exported by BSD make when run in parallel mode, and
	which can confuse make processes spawned by our testsuite.
	This change fixes a lot of spurious failure when the testsuite
	is run with BSD make in parallel mode.

2010-06-09  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Modernize, improve and/or fix various test scripts.
	* tests/sanity.test: Rely on the `configure.in' stub created by
	`./defs', rather than writing one from scratch.
	* tests/depend2.test: Likewise.  Also, call `set -e' just after
	the inclusion of `./defs', instead that later in the script.
	* tests/canon5.test: Avoid a useless `|| Exit 1' after a call to
	$AUTOMAKE, and improve the positioning of an $ACLOCAL call.
	* tests/exeext4.test: Use $FGREP instead of grep, where possible.
	Make auxiliary rules in the generated Makefile more silent.
	These changes make some checks slightly stricter.
	* tests/ext2.test: Call `Exit 1' if inclusion of `./defs' fails.
	* tests/gettext2.test: Place final `:' at the end of the script,
	rather than in the middle.
	* tests/exeext.test: Call `set -e' just after the inclusion of
	`./defs', instead that later in the script.
	* tests/extra5.test: Likewise.
	* tests/confdeps.test: Likewise.  Also, prefer `mv -f' over
	plain `mv', just to be sure.
	* tests/depcomp.test: Enable `errexit' shell flag, with related
	changes.  Also, modernize the generated configure.in.
	* tests/cond9.test: Likewise.  Also, rely on the `configure.in'
	stub created by `./defs', rather than writing one from scratch.

	AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS to `foreign' in the generated Makefile.am,
	since that flag is already provided by $AUTOMAKE.
	* tests/mdate.test: Made stricter, by checking that Automake
	actually failed, and by	making a stricter grep on the error
	message.  Also, set shell `errexit flag'.
	* tests/python2.test: Improved verbose messages.

	Make test `ammissing.test' stricter.
	* tests/ammissing.test: Fail if $ACLOCAL succeeds unexpectedly.
	Enable `errexit' shell flag.

	Improve ext.test semantics, avoid OpenBSD sh errexit issue.
	* tests/ext.test: Inside shell compound command, use
	`if $cmd; then Exit 1; fi' rather than `$cmd && Exit 1', to
	fix failure with OpenBSD sh introduced with last patch.
	Actually ensure that a rule for .EXT.o is created for each
	known extension EXT.

	Rewrite manual to be gender-neutral.
	* doc/automake.texi (GNU Build System)
	(Standard Directory Variables, General Operation, CVS)
	(Hard-Coded Install Paths, Dependencies As Side Effects):

	Report by Christina Gratorp.

	* AUTHORS: Update.

2010-06-06  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make tests on user extensibility of silent-rules mode stricter.
	* tests/silent6.test: Made stricter w.r.t. the grepping of the
	output produced by `make'.
	* tests/silent7.test: Likewise.

	Tests on silent-mode for C/Libtool made stricter.
	* tests/silent.test: Made stricter w.r.t. the grepping of the
	output produced by `make'.
	* tests/silent2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/silent4.test: Likewise.
	* tests/silent9.test: Likewise.
	* tests/silent3.test: Likewise, and add a final `make distclean'
	command to keep it better in sync with tests/silent{4,9}.test.

	Improved test silent5.test.
	* tests/silent5.test: Remove by hand all generated C files after
	non-verbose builds, to ensure the following builds are clean.
	Try to clean and rebuild with the same verbosity and without
	removing generated sources in between, to check that this does
	not trigger a different set of rules.  Make grepping of make's
	output stricter.  Improved/added some comments.

	New tests for Automake silent-mode with Fortran.
	* tests/silentf77.test: New test.
	* tests/silentf90.test: Likewise.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.

	Relax tests on silent-rules to cater to overly verbose makes.
	* tests/silent.test: When testing silent builds, don't fail if
	make's output simply contains the `mv' substring, but only if
	it contains the `mv ' substring (note the trailing space).
	* tests/silent2.test: Likewise.
	* tests/silent3.test: Likewise.

2010-01-24  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix silent-rules output for disabled dependency tracking.
	* lib/am/depend2.am [!%FASTDEP%]: Rework silent-rules variable
	expansion code to also work in the case where %AMDEP% expands
	to FALSE at config.status time, using new substitution string
	%VERBOSE-NODEP%.
	* automake.in (verbose_nodep_flag): New function, appending
	`@am__nodep@' to the verbose-variable name.
	(handle_languages): If dependencies are not disabled, use it to
	set %VERBOSE-NODEP%.
	* m4/depend.m4: Substitute am__nodep as '_no', so the second
	verbose-variable will always expand to an empty string, if
	dependencies are enabled.
	* tests/silent5.test: Also test --disable-dependency-tracking;
	also test per-target flags for non-C language files.
	* tests/silent9.test: New test, like silent4.test but disable
	dependency tracking.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.
	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.
	Report by Dmitry V. Levin <ldv@altlinux.org>.

2010-05-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Extend test on `nostdinc' automake option.
	* tests/nostdinc.test: Enable `errexit' shell flag.  Related and
	unrelated minor changes.  Make the grepping of the generated
	Makefile.in slightly stricter.  Generate and run configure, so that
	the generated Makefile can be grepped too.

2010-05-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Make gnupload portable to EBCDIC hosts.
	* lib/gnupload: Use literal newline as argument for 'tr' rather
	than \015, for EBCDIC hosts.  Also, avoid unportable nested
	double-quotes and backquotes.
	* THANKS: Update.
	Report from Eric Blake and Steve Goetze via gnulib.

2010-05-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix Autoconf version required by Automake's configure.
	Automake configure script used to tell that automake required
	autoconf 2.60 or later, but then it checked for autoconf >= 2.62,
	and if that was not found, it gave an error saying that Automake
	required configure 2.61a-341 or later.  This change should
	eliminate such inconsistencies.
	* configure.ac ($required_autoconf_version): New variable.
	Use it throughout.

2010-05-23  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix unportable sed script in maintainer-check test.
	* Makefile.am (sc_tests_Exit_not_exit): Rewrite sed script to
	not contain semicolon after 'b' or brace commands, for NetBSD.

	Wildcards are not portable to NetBSD make.
	* doc/automake.texi (Wildcards): Document portability issue.
	* tests/extra10.test, tests/extra11.test, tests/extra12.test:
	Require GNU make.

2010-05-23  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make test for configure.in vs. configure.ac stricter.
	* tests/configure.test: Use a configure.in file that provokes
	an automake error, to ensure configure.ac is preferred.

	Avoid possible false negatives in dejagnu7.test.
	* tests/dejagnu7.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag.  Also, avoid
	unportable use of fgrep option `-e'.

	Fix conflnk3.test to work with Solaris/Heirloom Sh.
	* tests/conflnk3.test: Use `test -r FILE' and `test ! -r FILE'
	instead of respectively `test -e FILE' and `test ! -e FILE',
	since Solaris Sh doesn't grok the latter.  Do not SKIP the test
	if the shell doesn't support `test -e'.

2010-04-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix typo in manual.
	* doc/automake.texi (Simple Tests using parallel-tests): Add
	missing closing parenthesis.

	Fix leftover call to removed function macros_dump.
	* automake.in (read_main_am_file): Call variables_dump, not
	macros_dump.  Print actual error before list of variables.

2010-04-25  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Minor improvements in comments of test `silent3.test'.
	* tests/silent3.test: Tell to keep it in sync with `silent9.test'
	too.

2010-04-25  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	testsuite: ensure verbose printing of captured output.
	* tests/acloca14.test, tests/acloca18.test, tests/aclocal.test,
	tests/fort2.test, tests/help.test, tests/missing3.test,
	tests/missing6.test: Print captured stdout or stderr before
	grepping it.

2010-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Make test badopt.test stricter (by enabling `set -e').
	* tests/badopt.test: Add call to `set -e'.  Due to this change,
	an unexpected failure in the call to `$ACLOCAL' (whose outcome
	was previously unchecked) would cause the whole test to fail.
	Also, bumped the copyright years.

	Make test for configure.in vs. configure.ac stricter.
	* tests/configure.test: Use a configure.in file that provokes
	an automake error, to ensure configure.ac is preferred.

	Use `set -e' in confsub.test (avoids possible false negatives).
	* tests/confsub.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag, and related
	changes (this helps avoiding some possible minor false negatives).
	Also, bumped copyright years.

2010-04-20  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix -Werror handling for presence of configure.in and configure.ac.
	* lib/Automake/Variable.pm (Automake::Variable): Do not initialize
	$configure_ac at the global level, before command-line arguments
	have been parsed.
	(require_variables): Initialize it here.
	* tests/configure.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update.
	Report by Stefano Lattarini.

2010-04-20  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid possible false negatives in confh5.test.
	* tests/confh5.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag, and bumped
	copyright years.  Due to this change, any unexpected failure
	in calls to $ACLOCAL, $AUTOMAKE, $AUTOCONF or $AUTOHEADER, or
	a failure in grepping expected text in output files should now
	cause the whole test to fail.

2010-04-17  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fixed typo in POD documentation of Automake::Channels.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm: Fixed typo in POD documentation:
	@<...> was used instead of C<...>.

2010-04-14  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Refactor tests on Automake TESTS color output.
	* tests/color.test: Tests using the expect program moved out to...
	* tests/color2.test: ... this new file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Extended accordingly.

2010-04-12  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Fix typos in comments in test confh5.test
	* tests/confh5.test: Fix a couple of typos in comments.

	Avoid possible false negatives in canon-name.test.
	* tests/canon-name.test: Enable shell `errexit' flag.  Improve
	test description.

2010-04-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Fix per-Makefile.am setting of -Werror.
	Before this patch, 'AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = -Werror' in one
	Makefile.am would carry over to other Makefile.am files
	treated afterwards by the same thread, causing inconsistent
	and unstable exit status values.
	* lib/Automake/Channels.pm (dup_channel_setup)
	(drop_channel_setup): Save and restore the setting of
	$warnings_are_errors.
	* tests/werror3.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Adjust.
	* NEWS: Update.

2010-04-11  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Bugfix in confh5.test w.r.t. Solaris/Heirloom Sh.
	* tests/confh5.test: In the generated Makefile.am: do not use
	`test ! -e FILE' to check for the non-existence of a file, since
	that is not supported by Solaris/Heirloom Sh.

	Make test `aclocal3.test' stricter.
	* tests/aclocal3.test: Add call to `set -e'.  Fail if $ACLOCAL
	succeds unexpectedly.

	Add tests checking that symlinks are resolved by `make dist'.
	* tests/distlinks.test: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Updated accordingly.
	Suggested by observations from Ralf Wildenhues.

2010-04-11  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Use -9 for maximum xz compression with dist-xz.
	* lib/am/distdir.am (dist-xz, dist, dist-all): Pass -9 to xz.
	* NEWS, THANKS: Update.
	Report by Pavel Sanda.

2010-03-30  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Avoid an unportable use of `$status' shell variable.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): Don't use the `$status' shell variable
	in the target's rules, as it's special in Zsh (equivalent to `$?',
	and readonly).

	Avoid another use of `chmod -R'.
	* Makefile.am (path-check): To be safe, do not use `chmod -R' on
	$(distdir) before removing it (as Solaris `chmod -R' touches
	symlink targets).  Instead, use the cleanup strategy used in
	distdir.am.

2010-03-28  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Remove uses of @acronym and @sc.
	* doc/automake.texi (Public Macros, Limitations on File Names):
	Remove all usage of @acronym and @sc in the manual.
	Suggested by Karl Berry.

2010-03-13  Karl Berry  <karl@freefriends.org>

	GNU hello uses fdl.texi, not gpl.texi.
	* doc/automake.texi (Texinfo): Adjust example to upstream
	change.

2010-03-06  Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Formatting cleanups in macro comments.
	* automake.in, lib/Automake/Channels.pm,
	lib/Automake/FileUtils.pm, lib/Automake/Options.pm,
	lib/Automake/Variable.pm, lib/Automake/XFile.pm,
	m4/options.m4, m4/substnot.m4: Fix macro comment format.

2010-03-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>
	    Ralf Wildenhues  <Ralf.Wildenhues@gmx.de>

	Avoid generation of `tests/defs-p' file.
	* tests/defs.in: In the generated `configure.in' snippet: call
	`AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE' with the `parallel-tests' option if the shell
	variable `parallel_tests' is set to `yes'.
	* tests/Makefile.am (defs-p): Target removed.
	(check_SCRIPTS): Removed `defs-p'.
	(clean-local-check): Do not unlink `defs-p' anymore.
	($(parallel_tests)): Transformation rules for the test scripts
	adjusted.
	* tests/gen-parallel-tests: Selection rules for the test
	scripts adjusted.
	* tests/parallel-tests.test: Set `$parallel_tests' to `yes'
	then include `./defs' (rather than simply including `./defs-p').

	behaviour.  Some other minor related improvements.
	* tests/.gitignore (defs-p): Removed.

2010-03-04  Stefano Lattarini  <stefano.lattarini@gmail.com>

	Remove redundant unset of variable TESTS from some test scripts.
	* tests/color.test: Do not unset the `TESTS' variable, as it's
	already unset in the `defs' file.
	* tests/check5.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check8.test: Likewise.
	* tests/check9.test: Likewise.

2010-02-22  Karl Berry  <karl@gnu.org>

	Improve help message of mdate-sh.
	* mdate-sh: mention actual output format in help message.
