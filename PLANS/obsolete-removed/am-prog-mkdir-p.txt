We have dropped any plan to remove the obsolescent macro AM_PROG_MKDIR_P,
(today just an alias for the Autoconf-provided macro AC_PROG_MKDIR_P), as
well as the related $(mkdir_p) make variable and the @mkdir_p@ configure
substitution.

That planned removal has already proven source of countless headaches and
backward-compatibility issues, which vastly outweigh any "clean-up benefit"
we would get from the removal of that obsolescent but unobtrusive cruft.
