# "make dist" incorrect when AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR is present.
#
# == Report ==
# When AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR is set (in my case to `support'), make dist
# no longer automatically includes config.guess, config.sub, install-sh,
# ltconfig, ltmain.sh, mdate-sh, missing, and mkinstalldirs.  In fact,
# the entire `support/' directory is omitted.
